# Party Game Web App - Simple Tech Stack

## Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (for quick responsive styling)
- **Build Tool**: Vite (faster than Create React App)

## Backend & Real-time Communication
- **Platform**: Firebase (all-in-one solution)
  - Firestore (real-time database)
  - Firebase Authentication
  - Firebase Hosting
  - Firebase Cloud Functions (for any complex logic)

## Key Benefits of This Stack
1. **Minimal Setup**: Firebase handles database, authentication, and hosting in one platform
2. **Real-time by Default**: Firestore provides real-time updates essential for multiplayer games
3. **No Complex Backend**: Avoid building custom Node.js/Express server
4. **Scalable**: Can handle growing user base without infrastructure changes
5. **Quick Development**: Faster time-to-market with less custom code

```

## Development Simplifications
- No need to maintain separate backend codebase
- Authentication comes ready to use
- Real-time sync handled automatically by Firestore
- Hosting and deployment through simple Firebase CLI commands

This tech stack focuses on simplicity while providing all the functionality you need for your party game app. Firebase's real-time capabilities are perfectly suited for multiplayer games, and you won't need to set up and maintain complex server infrastructure.
